[Scene: Jonah Daggerfell’s Operation room. A female body covered in cloth lays on an operation table.]

Jonah
*Huff* *Puff* (Deep breaths, Jonah. You’ve done this several times before, it’s going to be well.)

Jonah
(Just… follow the protocol. Review the manual if you need it, it’s perfectly acceptable.)

[A manual describes the instructions for a seance minigame.]

TOME OF RESURRECTION

Step 1: Soul Inspection

As a necessary step for employee resurrection, necromancers must perform a psychological evaluation to make sure the spirit is stable and willing to return to the realm of the living.

Select the appropriate runes based on the employee’s background and start asking: “Are there any spirits in the room?”

(Etc.)

Jonah
Are there any spirits in the room?

[All the runes turn face up.]

Jonah
Lyria Silvermoon, are you in my presence? Please, show yourself!

[Lyria’s spirit fades in.]

Lyria
Jonah… Why are you summoning me? Aren’t you going to revive me?

Jonah
Lyria! Thank Lordran you’re well!

Jonah
I wanted to check the state of your spirit. Besides, it’s part of the procedure. You know this.

Lyria
Right… Yes.

Jonah
How are you feeling? Are you stable?

Lyria
Relatively. I feel anchored enough, but I sense I had a terrible death.

Jonah
Yes… I know. I read the report.

Jonah
*Deep sigh* Can you recount what happened before your expiration?



Lyria
It was bloody… The greatest Behemoth I’ve ever seen. I watched him rip apart every member of my unit, one by one. I was the last.

Jonah
I’m so sorry, my dear… But you’re strong. I’m glad to see your spirit remains firm after an experience like that.

Lyria
Yes… Certainly.

Jonah
What about you? How are you feeling at the moment?

Lyria
I feel… nothing.

Jonah
…Are you sure? Can you describe any thoughts? Any sensations?

Lyria
I feel… cold. Seeing my team fall in front of me brought me great pain, but after my death… I’m completely numb.

Jonah
Oh, Lyria… All is well. You will trudge along this path. I’m here with you.

Lyria
…

Jonah
Remember how you wanted to visit Novaria for our next holiday? Are you still looking forward to that?

Lyria
*Gasp* Yes…

Jonah
Good. Hang onto that feeling. You’re in good hands. I brought you back before and I’ll do it again. I swear on Lordran.

Lyria
Thank you.

Lyria
I love you, Jonah.


Jonah
I love you, Lyria.

Jonah
With that said, are you willing to return to the realm of the living?

Lyria
I consent.

Jonah
Good. Any last words before your reanimation?

Lyria
…How… What’s the state of my body?

Jonah
I haven’t looked yet. Based on the reports, it wasn’t in a pristine state.

Lyria
…

Jonah
But once again, don’t worry: you’re in good hands. I’ll revive you in the Sun or Rain, even if I have to rip you out of the hands of Myrra herself.

Lyria
*Giggle* Thank you.

Lyria
Good luck, Jonah.

[Lyria vanishes.]

Jonah
(Note: spirit is anchored. Resurrection consent: approved.)

Jonah
(I’ll uncover the body.)

[Jonah uncovers the body. Lyria’s body has been ripped apart limb by limb. The head, torso, arms and legs are separated.]

[Lyria’s limbs have scars from previous operations. Some of the parts may have been already replaced by mismatching looking body parts from other races.]

Jonah
(*Gulp* Just as the report described. Focus, Jonah, your love’s life depends on it!)

Step 2. Body reassembly

Stitch together any dismembered body parts. Connect electric diodes to the head’s temples.
Once finished, flip the power switch on to reanimate the body.

Jonah
(Here goes…)

Jonah
Rise, Lyria, rise!

[Power turns on and electricity flows through Lyria’s body. She slowly opens her eyes.]

Jonah
Lyria! Are you alive? Please, speak!

Lyria
Jonah… I…

Lyria
…

[Lyria’s body begins to convulse.]

Lyria
Blargh!

Jonah
Lyria? Are you well?! Say something!

Lyria
Shed your blood, meager mortal- Blood for Haxos! Blood for the Neatherlord!

In case the body displays signs of possession, such as unusual speech, immediately turn the power off.

[Player turns the switch off.]

Jonah
(This is strange… is her body possessed? Behemoths aren’t nether creatures, it’s impossible one of them could corrupt her body.)

Jonah
(This corruption must’ve been dormant for a while. I must replace the corrupt body parts until the entire body is pure!)

In case of possession, one or more body parts must be corrupt. Replace whichever body parts you suspect may be the object of corruption and turn the power on again for a reanimation test.

If the body remains possessed, use a process of elimination to determine which body parts are corrupt and which are pure.

[After player successfully assembles the body:]

Jonah
Lyria? Are you yourself again?

Lyria
…

Lyria
Ah…

Lyria
AAAAAAAAHH!!!

Jonah
*Covers ears in pain* Lyria! Control yourself!

Lyria
Make it stop! MAKE IT STOP! The pain is unbearable! I shouldn’t have come back! PLEASE, MAKE IT STOP!!!

[Player turns the power off again.]

Jonah
(How is this possible?! An incompatible reaction? Lyria has never suffered one before!)

Jonah
(I must perform another evaluation immediately!)

Jonah
Are there any spirits in this room?

[Runes flip positively]

Jonah
Lyria Silvermoon, please, show yourself!

[Lyria manifests.]

Lyria
What happened? That felt awful!
Jonah
Don’t worry, you just had an incompatible reaction. It happens when the body and the mind aren’t adequately in tune.

Jonah
I’m not sure why it happened… Maybe there was a latent curse undetected or some malfunction in the brain?

Jonah
Gah! I’m so stupid! How did I not see it in the horizon?!

Lyria
All is well, Jonah. Do not punish yourself for it.

Jonah
I’m afraid to announce your resurrection will have to wait. I must perform further diagnostics.

Jonah
Before I do, though, I must ask… Lyria, were you truly willing to come back to life?

Lyria
…

Lyria
I must confess… Through these recent years, I’ve had some reticence in my resurrections.

Jonah
What?! Why?

Lyria
Times are changing, Jonah… I’m not the same brave adventurer I once was. Now, I feel simply like a cog in the Dungeon Industry’s machinery. A meager shadow of my former self.

Lyria
Why should I come back to life if I’ll just perish once again? Every time, I feel my purpose fade more and more…

Lyria
What is my purpose anymore? To senselessly keep raining arrows upon monsters until my spirit finally breaks?

Jonah
Lyria, please, do not speak like that… You have so much to live for! You are merely 121! That’s about your mid twenties in elf years.

Lyria
I know, I’m an elf.

Jonah
Yeah… Think about your loved ones. Think about me. Are you ready to leave behind everything and everyone in your life?

Lyria
…

Lyria
I’m not so sure… I feel distressed.

Jonah
If you’re hurting, we can adjourn your evaluation. Just… please, think it over. I’m not ready to see you go just yet.

Lyria
…

Lyria
Very well. Farewell, Jonah.

Jonah
Goodbye.

[Lyria vanishes]

Jonah
(I’ll take some fluid samples and study them. There must be some reason behind that reaction.)

[Fade to black and back to scene.]

Jonah
*Gasp* (Just as I suspected. Her brain has become corrupted as well!)

[Note to self: spare details on this section and save for later.]

Jonah
(This is extremely troublesome. I can bless the brain and perform a new reassembly operation, but in a delicate state such as this it’s a highly risky operation.)

Jonah
(I could, instead, transplant a new brain, which would be far safer, but it comes with its own series of problems.)

Jonah
(Lyria’s soul would return to life, but with a different brain her memories will most likely be gone. Not to mention finding a healthy replacement brain won’t be cheap.)



Jonah
*Deep sigh* (Either way, I cannot mention this in my report. It’s unlikely the company’s insurance covers a second operation, much less with a corrupt brain involved!)

Jonah
(I’ll schedule a meeting with the Overseer tomorrow.) *Groan* (This’ll be a long night.)
