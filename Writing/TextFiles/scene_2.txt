[Night to day transition.]

[Parsley Hawthorne, the Overseer, enters the scene.]

Hawthorne
Good afternoon, Mr. Daggerfell. I hope you’ve slept well, given the circumstances.

Jonah
Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne. I’m bearing as well as I can.

Hawthorne
That is good to hear. I read your report regarding the state of Ms. Silvermoon’s body. Very gruesome. This is the 5th death since she joined the company, isn’t it?

Jonah
That is correct.

Hawthorne
How tragic. In the name of the company, I must recognize the strength and dedication given my Ms. Lyria Silvermoon. It is unprecedented for an employee to sustain so many deaths and keep standing bold.

Jonah
(Here we go…)

Hawthorne
Unfortunately, you’re aware of how these procedures go, aren’t you, Mr. Daggerfell? I’m afraid her body is simply in a deep state of decay. In consequence, I’m afraid my only choice is-

Jonah
Can you cut to the chase, Sir?! What’s it going to take so you don’t butcher her like a wild hog?!

Hawthorne
Mr. Daggerfell, please. You assume too much malice out of me and the company. We only want what’s best for everyone, I assure you.

Hawthorne
Yes, it is evident Ms. Silvermoon’s body has become quite a liability. But! We are willing to make a compromise.



Hawthorne
The board of human resources has spoken and we are willing to cover the costs of Lyria Silvermoon’s resurrection- in exchange of her renewing her contract for 10 more years.

Jonah
*Gasp*

Hawthorne
Of course, she will not perform the same duties she once did as a special forces unit. Instead, she will likely be relegated to either assembly work or clerical duties.

Jonah
Hmm… And what if she were to perish again during her performance of duties? What will happen to her body?

Hawthorne
…

Hawthorne
Well, as it is natural for any employee in such a state, her body will become the property of-

Jonah
Never! I said I wouldn’t let you take ownership of her!

Hawthorne
Mr. Daggerfell, you must understand the company needs profits. We cannot simply give her a second chance for free!

Hawthorne
…Unless, you’re willing to cover the costs.

Jonah
…

Jonah
I will speak to her. You’ll have her answer as soon as possible.

Hawthorne
Pleasure doing business with you, Mr. Hawthorne.

[...]

[Jonah summons Lyria again.]

Lyria
Greetings, Jonah.


Jonah
Greetings, my love. I ran my diagnostics and spoke to the Overseer. I implore you that you brace yourself for the news I am about to deliver.

Lyria
…

Jonah
You have a corrupt brain. This is a common occurrence for someone who tampers with the undead like you for a series of years. Unfortunately, this was a latent corruption, which is why it didn’t make itself evident in your latest tests.

Jonah
*Deep breath*

Jonah
We have two options on how to proceed. Your first option is for me to bless your brain and perform a new reassembly operation. But in a delicate state such as yours this a highly risky operation.

Jonah
It is possible, despite my best efforts, that the operation has long lasting effects on your body that will carry for the rest of your life.

Lyria
And the second option?

Jonah
Your second option is to receive an entire brain transplant. Essentially, your soul will inhabit a new body with another person’s brain. You will inherit their personality and memories, but your conciousness will remain the same.

Jonah
This is a much safer option, but it comes with its own series of problems.

Jonah
It won’t be cheap. A brain is a much more hefty part to purchase at the Shell Market. Additionally, most of your original memories will be gone.

Jonah
You may retain your past experiences as part of a spiritual subconsciousness, but for the most part you will be a new person born in a new body. Am I making myself clear?

Lyria
…Yes.

Jonah
I would be remiss not to mention one more thing. The company has decided it won’t cover the costs of your resurrection anymore: unless you’re willing to renew your contract for another 10 years.

Jonah
This is only an option if you choose to retain your brain. If we were to purchase a new one, that’s coming out of our pockets. Logically, the company won’t hire you anymore because you’ll lose your training and, well…

Jonah
We have no way of knowing if the new “you” would even want to have anything to do with the company anyways.

Lyria
…This is a lot to take in. I didn’t expect my body to be in such a state of decay.

Jonah
Yes. To be clear, this wasn’t a recent event. This is the result of years of contact with nether creatures. But of course… multiple resurrections have a hand as well.

Jonah
Human resurrection entails making a bargain with the netherworld, which is why even in the best conditions, some degree of impurity will seep in.

Lyria
I see.

Lyria
What is your opinion? What do you think I should do?

[Choice:]
[Brain purification]
[Brain transplant]
[I don’t want to bias you]

[Brain purification]

Jonah
I think the best choice for you is brain purification. Yes, it has its risks, but with my expert hand I can undermine them as much as elvenly possible.

Jonah
If you put any value on your memories, fighting for them is the most logical choice no matter what.

Lyria
Didn’t you say the other option was the safest?

Jonah
Yes, well. I didn’t say it didn’t come with it’s own risks. The side effects of cerebral soul bond are an understudied area of science, both physically and psychologically.

Jonah
Adopting a new personality may have entirely unpredictable effects on your psyche. You may be fine, or you may take on heavy amounts of stress or delirium.

Jonah
Not to mention the financial burden the operation would have for both of us. I could be indebted for the company for years, but you’ll certainly be out of a job.

Lyria
That is true.

Jonah
And most importantly: we’ll still have each other. Don’t you think it’s valuable to fight for our sakes, even when there’s a risk?

Lyria
Well, yes, of course. If there wasn’t any other factor, I’d choose you any time.

Jonah
Precisely! And I would choose you anytime as well! Trust me, Lyria, this is for your own good. I will focus the entirety of my being so not a spec of your beautiful flesh is out of place.

Lyria
…

Lyria
Very well, Jonah. I… I trust you.

Jonah
Brilliant. I’ll start with the preparations soon.

[I don’t want to bias you]

Jonah
This is a great choice and I don’t want to influence you one way or another. No matter what you choose, it will entirely change your life and I shouldn’t have a say on the matter.

Lyria
But if I lose my memories, we won’t be together anymore, will we? I am guaranteed, for the most part, to forget all about you, our experiences…

Jonah
Yes, that is true. However, if that’s what you wish for yourself, I won’t protest against your choice.

Jonah
You have the right for a second chance. A safe second chance. My own wishes shouldn’t matter in the equation.

Lyria
But do you want me to forget you? If it were up to you, would you let me become a blank slate and start a new life?

[Choice:]
[Yes]
[No]

[Yes]

Jonah
Yes, of course I would! Because I love you! If I have to choose between your love and your safety, I will always choose your safety!

Lyria
…

[Note to self: change “crutch” later]

Lyria
I don’t know what to think. For always, I’ve considered myself to be your crutch. I know you’ve had a difficult life and you’ve bared your pain on your own.

Lyria
I don’t want a second chance if it means you’ll be left all alone.

Jonah
…

Jonah
I may have… overelied on you at some point. It’s true I’ve always appreciated being able to rely on you, but I never wanted you to feel like I couldn’t live without you.

Jonah
You were… are my rain of sunshine, the light that guides me in the darkness when everything else fails me.

Jonah
I don’t want to lose you, but I love you too much to lead you to harm.

Lyria
*Gasp* Jonah…

Lyria
…

Lyria
I’ll think about it. For how longer will my spirit remain stable?

Jonah
It is extremely variable. Based on external factors such as ether currents and spirit currents you could remain stable a hundred years or a week.

Jonah
For your own good, I recommend you make a decision as soon as possible.

Lyria
Very well.
