[Background: Operation room.]

[Variable: Purification]

Jonah
Are you ready, Lyria?

Lyria
Yes.

Lyria
But… Just… Are you absolutely certain about this, Jonah?

Jonah
With every fiber of my being! Lyria, this isn’t a promise: it’s a declaration. This is the best decision you could’ve made. You will see.

Lyria
Okay. If you say so.

Lyria
Jonah, I… I love you.

Jonah
I love you to, my beloved agathebloom. May Cynthia protect you on your journey.

Lyria
Always.

Lyria
In that case, I suppose I will see you soon, yes?

Jonah
Of course. Like always, this will just be a brief dream.

Jonah
Goodbye, Lyria.

[Lyria vanishes.]

Jonah
(Very well. Time of operation begins: six o’ clock.)

Jonah
(Into the beyond.)

[Operation takes place.]

Jonah
(Phew! That was draining… It was definitely one of the most challenging operations I’ve ever made.)

Jonah
(But it’ll be worth it. Oh, my darling Lyria… Soon, we’ll be together again. And for the rest of your time.)

Lyria
Mph…

Jonah
Lyria? (How is this possible? She couldn’t possibly be waking up this soon.)

Lyria
Ugh…

Jonah
Lyria, are you well? Do you have any discomfort?

Lyria
It… it stings. Like fire. What is this…?

Jonah
You say it stings?

Lyria
*Huff* *Puff* Jonah, I don’t feel well. I don’t feel well at all. It’s burning.

Jonah
What is burning, dear?

Lyria
Everything! My insides, my skin, my head…

Jonah
Don’t worry, I’ll get you a cooling agent immediately.

Lyria
It… Ugh! It burns so intensely! Please, make it stop!

Jonah
Here, does it feel better?

Lyria
No, no it doesn’t…

Jonah
Strange… I’ll get another one, then.

Lyria
What are these… thoughts?

Jonah
Thoughts?

Lyria
They’re telling me to… Consume. Gash. Destroy.

Jonah
What?! Impossible! I entirely purified your brain! You shouldn’t be showing signs of possession.

Lyria
Ugh… What are these thoughts!?! IT HURTS!

Jonah
Unless… Neither the body or the brain were corrupted.

Jonah
Was it… the soul, all along?

Lyria
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?!!!?!

Jonah
Calm, Lyria. This agent will put you to sleep immediately.

[Sound of chain breaking.]

Lyria
Raaah!

Jonah
(She-she broke out of her bond! How is that possible?) 

Jonah
(What is this… thing?)

Lyria
MAKE IT STOP!!!!!!

Jonah
Stay back, Lyria! Don’t make me use my silver rune, you know I will!

Lyria
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE ME TO DO THIS?!!?

Jonah
Gah!

Lyria
You always do the same. You talk, talk and never listen! I was better off dead than this and I knew it!!!

Jonah
Lyria, please… calm down.

Lyria
DON’T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN! YOU MONSTER! Kept me hostage all those years, bringing me back and forth like a windup toy!

Lyria
Well, WHO’S THE TOY NOW?!!

Jonah
Aaaahhhhhhh!!!

Lyria
It burns… in my mind… Lordran’s brother, Zephyr… The end-bringer… I can’t shut it down.

Lyria
WHY DID YOU DO THIS?!?! IT’S ALL PAIN, PAIN, PAIN!!!!

Jonah
…

[Time passes.]

Lyria
*Huff* *Puff*

Lyria
Where… Where am I? Jonah?

Lyria
Where are you? Did the operation succeed? Am I alive?

Lyria
*Gasp* Jonah!

Lyria
What happened, how did this-

Lyria
Wait. Did I do this?

Lyria
Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no!

Lyria
Jonah… *Sobs* I didn’t want this… I didn’t want this to happen!

Lyria
Why did I-? Why did you?

[Sudden sound.]

Lyria
*Gasp* (I can’t let them find me like this! I have to run!)

And so, with cursed breath and sluggish steps, Lyria fled the dreaded Company, once and for all. Or so she hoped.

In a disoriented step, she ran to the slums of Zegobia until she found an abandoned den.

She rested, uncertain of her immediate fate.

A mismatched body and a terrible urge were the burdens she would bear for years and years. Running away from the company, hiding her condition, making sure not to harm an innocent again.

Although it was bitter and full of peril, a secret part of her was shamefully glad.

In a way, she was finally free. For better or worse for her former captor.

Would things have worked differently if she had negated? She would never know.

The only certain thing was another night and another bout of hunger. 

Never ending hunger.

Goodbye.


[Variable: Transplant]

Lyria
Jonah. I have made my decision.

Lyria
I want a brain transplant. I would rather take a second chance at life than keep withering under the sterile shell of my current mind.

[Choice:]
[Accept decision]
[Protest]

[Accept decision]

Jonah
Very well. I accept your decision.

Lyria
…Are you sure? You don’t want to discuss it further?

Jonah
No. I understand. For the sake of your wellbeing, this is the most logical decision from you.

Lyria
I see… Thank you for your reassurance.

Jonah
…

Jonah
Before you go, Lyria, I have a few things to say.

Jonah
I realize wasn’t always the most permissive lover. I’ve been thinking back and I realized I may have taken matters that concerned you in my own hands when perhaps I shouldn’t have.

Jonah
Such as recommending you worked with me at the company, or my previous taking charge over your medical decisions.

Jonah
Maybe it is for the best that you have a new start. I don’t think continuing things as they were would’ve made either of us any favors.

Lyria
Jonah…

Lyria
If you wish to know my opinion, I think you’re a good man. You’ve covered my whole operation even though soon I will become a stranger to you.

Lyria
I am aware of the… unbalanced nature of our relationship. But until now I have always agreed with you because I love you and I wanted to make you happy.

Lyria
Perhaps I am biased.

Lyria
Still… I will miss you. Or, at the very least, my spirit will.

Jonah
I’ll miss you as well.

[Fade to black.]

Jonah
After that, we kept talking about the good times one last time before I made my final preparations.

[Fade back to scene.]

Jonah
Are you ready?

Lyria
Yes. One last thing, Jonah. When I wake up, I want you to hand me this.

Jonah
A letter? Did you write it yourself?

Lyria
Yes. I have become surprisingly adept at manipulating the physical realm in spirit form.

Lyria
It’s a letter to myself. Please, don’t read it.


Jonah
I won’t.

Lyria
Goodbye, Jonah.

Jonah
…

Jonah
Goodbye.

[Lyria vanishes]

[Frankenstein minigame 2]

Jonah
(The operation was a success! The body and the mind shows no signs of corruption.)

Jonah
…

Jonah
(Farewell, Lyria. Perhaps we’ll meet in another life.)

[Fade to black and back to scene.]
[??? is Lyria.]

???
Hello? Is this Parsley Hawthorne’s office?

Hawthorne
Ah, yes! Miss Silvermoon, I was expecting you.

Hawthorne
Excuse me, I should say, Miss Maple Laezel.

Maple
Yes, that is my name. I believe.

Maple
I must say, I’m still a bit disoriented since I awoke.

Hawthorne
Certainly. Allow me to shed some light into the situation.



Hawthorne
Your name is Maple Laezel. You used to be an alchemist assistant until three years ago, when your body expired after a failed experiment.

Maple
*Gulp*

Hawthorne
Since your family couldn’t afford a resurrection, your body and mind were donated to the Shell market, until the mind was purchased out of pocket by a former employee of our corporation, Mr. Jonah Daggerfell.

Hawthorne
He used your brain to replace that of another former employee, Miss Lyria Silvermoon. Miss Silvermoon’s body was in such a worn state after years of service to the corporation, the only solution the only solution was a brain transplant. Which was yours.

Maple
So… Am I still me?

Hawthorne
That is a complicated matter to answer. As far as you can sense and feel: yes, you are still you. But in truth your spirit is not the same as former “Maple Laezel”, but Lyria Silvermoon. As most of your body parts.

Hawthorne
Excuse me- some of your body parts.

Maple
I see. That’s why I woke up in a different body.

Hawthorne
Precisely! Now, it is my role to inform you as Personnel Overseer of this company that as of officiate immediately you no longer work for this company.

Hawthorne
Not like you have any memory of ever working here, so no harm no foul, isn’t that right?

Maple
I suppose so. I’ve been informed it was my host’s decision to resign, wasn’t it?

Hawthorne
Yes, but rest assured that it was simply a personal decision on her part. Nothing our company was responsibly liable for.

Maple
I see. In that case, thank you very much for your assistance, Mr. Hawthorne.

Hawthorne
And to you.

Maple
Ah! One more thing, before I leave. This Jonah Daggerfell gent… could you help me put in contact with him?

[Fade to black, back to scene.]
[Jonah now has an apothecary shop.]

Jonah
Thank you. Have a pleasant day.

[Store bell rings.]

???
Jonah? Is it you?

Jonah
Lyria!?!

Jonah
Oh. Excuse me. Maple Laezel, I suppose.

Maple
You suppose correctly. You are the man who performed my operation, yes?

Jonah
Indeed I am.

Maple
Thank you so, so much! Words cannot describe how grateful I am for you bringing me back to the realm of the living.

Jonah
None necessary. I was simply fulfilling my job.

Maple
Still! Not only did you hold the scalpel, you also handled the costs for the operation, didn’t you?

Jonah
Well… Yes. But please, have no feelings of debt towards me on that regard.

Jonah
I did it as a token for… someone else. Your current host, as far as you would know.


Maple
I have been informed of the situation. Lyria told me all about it on her letter-

[Sound effect: rustling paper]

Jonah
Oh Lordran. Please, I beg you, don’t show me that paper! I made a promise I wouldn’t read it.

Maple
You did? Oh well… In any case, she told me you were a very good person and if I ever needed help, I should contact you.

Jonah
Did she, now? *Snicker* Of course she did. She was wise beyond her years.

Maple
Indeed. In any case, if it’s not too forward, I was wondering if I could- uh- make your acquaintance some day? Perhaps over a spot of tea?

Jonah
Huh? Why?

Maple
Well… Lyria told me you were a good man. You could say I’m simply curious to know you. If that’s fair with you.

Jonah
…

Jonah
I believe it is, Miss Laezel.
